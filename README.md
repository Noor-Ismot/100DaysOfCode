# 100DaysOfCode Challenge Tracker ðŸ“…ðŸ’»
Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode challenge tracker! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days.

# What's in this Repo?
Daily Logs: Each day, I'll update this README with my progress, including what I've learned, challenges I've tackled, and any projects I've worked on.
Code Snippets: Throughout the challenge, I'll also include snippets of code I've written, either as part of my learning process or to solve specific problems.
Project Updates: As I progress, I'll link to any projects I'm working on or have completed during the challenge.
Goals
- Improve my proficiency in Python programming language.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through daily coding challenges.
- Expand my knowledge of software development concepts and tools.

# Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode
Progress: 
-Learned input/output handling in Python, 
- explored type conversion & custom output display,
- solved a character classification problem,
- and experimented with list input/output, importing libraries, and using map() function.<br>

Next Steps: Excited to continue exploring Python and taking on more coding challenges!

# Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode
Progress: Explored if-else and elif conditions for decision-making in Python, delved into Python 3.10's match case feature for pattern matching, and solved a problem related to conditions.
Next Steps: Continuing to deepen understanding of control flow and exploring more advanced Python features.<br>

Next Steps: Excited to continue exploring Python and taking on more coding challenges! Happy Coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“ˆ

# Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode
Progress: Explored for loops for repetitive tasks and nested loops for complex iterations in Python. Currently tackling the nth Fibonacci number problem.<br>

Next Steps: Continue working on the Fibonacci problem and dive deeper into other basic topics.

# Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode
Progress: Explored while loops for iterative tasks with unknown iterations and learned about break and continue statements for loop control. In addition, solved a problem involving summing even and odd digits of an integer.<br>
